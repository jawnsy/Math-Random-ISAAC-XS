Introduction
------------

ISAAC (Indirection, Shift, Accumulate, Add, and Count) is a [Cryptographically
Secure Pseudorandom Number Generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator)
(CSPRNG) that quickly produces high-quality random data.  The results are
uniformly distributed, unbiased, and unpredictable unless you know the seed.
Despite this, the algorithm is very fast: on average, it requires only 18.75
processor cycles to generate each 32-bit value.  As a result, ISAAC is
suitable for applications where a significant amount of random data needs to
be produced quickly, such as solving using the Monte Carlo method or for
games.

The algorithm was published by Bob Jenkins in 1996, along with a reference
implementation, and despite the best efforts of many security researchers, no
feasible attacks have been identified to date.  For more information, see the
[algorithm description](http://burtleburtle.net/bob/rand/isaac.html) and
[reference implementation](http://burtleburtle.net/bob/rand/isaacafa.html).

This module exposes the reference implementation via a foreign function
interface call (XS = XSUB = eXternal SUBroutine, see `perldoc perlxs`) and is
recommended for use wherever a C compiler toolchain is available, as it has
been shown to provide better performance in benchmarks.

Usage
-----

    use Math::Random::ISAAC; # automatically selects ::XS if available

    my $rng = Math::Random::ISAAC->new(@seeds);

    for (0..30) {
      print 'Result: ' . $rng->irand() . "\n";
    }
