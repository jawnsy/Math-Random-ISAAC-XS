1.001 - XXX - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + Remove generated files from the repository
  + Use a simple string version, per David Golden's article:
    http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/369/version-numbers-should-be-boring/
  + No longer use Perl::Critic to test

1.0.6 - 25 Jul 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + Rewrote POD a bit
  + The last variables using TEST_AUTHOR now use
    RELEASE_TESTING|AUTOMATED_TESTING
  + Overhaul test scripts, remove author tests from
    Recommends (Alias' journal #5375)
  + Provide a more generic README so I don't need to
    bother updating it.
  + Minor cleanups in the LICENSE
  + Removed CAVEATS from README
  + Updated copyright statements
  + Require Internet (TEST_INTERNET) to do the signature
    test, since it tries to download the key from a
    keyserver
  + Slight reformatting, nothing significant.
  + No longer enforce "one dot only" in filenames. This
    breaks compatibility with OpenVMS.
  + Minor formatting changes
  + Instead of joining the array, just pass an array ref
    (otherwise it is split into an array anyway) [Build.PL]
  + Clarified license for the case where public domain is
    not permitted (ie, Germany)
  + Applied patch from RT#46071 -- thanks to Taro Nishino. See:
    http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=46071

1.0.5 - 12 May 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + Add the Perl portability header ppport.h to MANIFEST
  + New simplified license - Public Domain (fallback on
    MIT, Artistic-2+, GPL-2+ only)
  + Removed requirement for minimum 'version' version
  + Added ppport.h for portability to older Perls (this
    hasn't been a problem so far, but `perl ppport.h'
    suggested it due to SvUV)
  + Added ExtUtils::ParseXS as a dependency; modules were
    failing to build on systems that don't have it
    installed, because the typemap isn't properly included
    by xsubpp/Module::Build. See:
    http://osdir.com/ml/lang.perl.modules.module-build/2005/msg00501.html
  + Made some changes mostly related to splint warnings:
    o Declared isaac() as static because it isn't used
      outside rand.c
  + Minor reformatting
  + Changed line to: if (ctx->randcnt-- == 0) { to make
    intent more obvious

1.0.4 - 06 May 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + Changed the valgrind test from an author test to
    its own special test - one must set TEST_VALGRIND=1
    to test the module through valgrind. This must be
    done until we have better suppression support
    upstream in Test::Valgrind.
  + Updated t/02valgrind.t so that tests are not planned
    (so Test::Valgrind can plan)
  + Removed version-specific stuff from the README
  + Reformatted the POD file
  + Updated support information in META.yml and Build.PL
  + Added some support information
  + Reformatted rand.c a bit; moved variable definitions
    to the top
  + Added .tmp to MANIFEST.SKIP
  + Made this a dynamic config (instead of using META.yml)
  + Added ExtUtils::CBuilder to META.yml
  + Added Build.bat to MANIFEST.SKIP for Win32 builds...

1.0.3 - 23 Apr 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + Rewrote docs a bit
  + Removed Pod::Usage dependency
  + Added some example files for benchmarking the module and
    charting out the distribution generated by the module :-)
  + Added Config to META.yml prerequisites (why not?). It's a
    core module so it wouldn't be missing anyway, and Build.PL
    would fail outright if it was.

1.0.2 - 21 Apr 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + Add Build.PL detection of int size
  + Version bumped to 1.0.2
  + A flag now controls whether 'int' or 'long' is used as the
    type: USE_INT. If Build.PL detects that int is 32bits wide,
    then it will use that type. Otherwise it'll use long, which
    is more portable.
  + A flag will control if the portability code is used. Right
    now this involves masking all numbers with "& 0xffffffff"
    to cut off the high bits - this code isn't necessary for
    32-bit variable widths, so we might squeeze a bit more
    performance out this way

1.0.1 - 07 Apr 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + Changed the bootstrap loading to use VERSION instead
    of VERSION->numify, so that they match (prevents compile
    errors with "object version v1.0 does not match bootstrap
    parameter 1.000000" (apparently causes failures in 50% of
    machines so far)

1.0 - 06 Apr 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + Initial release
