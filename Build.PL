# Determine what the 32bit unsigned type is. Based on the result, we can
# pass two flags to the C code which will affect their behaviour.
#
# USE_PORTABLE will determine whether we try to make our bit operations
# portable by ANDing them with 0xffffffff. This cuts off higher bits,
# so that our result is good.
#
# USE_INT will determine whether to use the 'int' type compared to 'long'.
# While 'long' is guaranteed to be 32 bits or larger, on some 64-bit systems,
# int is 32 bits and long is 64 bits. On these systems we force use of int.

# Note that even though they are currently presented that way, this does not
# necessarily mean that we must either USE_INT or USE_PORTABLE. There may be
# real cases where we don't want to USE_INT (and instead use long's, if they
# are somehow faster than ints) but are absolutely sure they are only 32bits.
# In that case we wouldn't need to USE_PORTABLE either.
